cyberpower
==========
A library and tool to control
[CyberPower PDUs](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/pdus/)
via SSH.

Tested on:
* [PDU41001](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/pdu/switched/pdu41001/), ePDU Firmware Version 1.2.4.
* [PDU81005](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/pdus/switched-mbo/pdu81005/), ePDU Firmware Version 1.2.4.

Why?
* Logging into the web GUI is a pain
* SSH oneliners don't appear to work (it's a janky SSH implementation)
* SNMP and NUT feel too complex for just on/off/cycle/status

Features:
* Will load your password out of your system keyring if you have it stored
    there (`keyring set <host> <user>`)
* `cyberpower <host> shell` command gives you shell access just like an
    SSH client

Establishing a connection typically takes ~5s on the LAN.
